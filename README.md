# Minimal Svelte + Sapper + Rollup starter kit

Add the features you want instead of having to remove all the stuff from the official template that you don't need.

The only extra feature I've added is SCSS support in `<style>` tags for components and also an example on how to add global styles. Thanks [Sean Schertell](https://medium.com/@sean_27490/svelte-sapper-with-sass-271fff662da9) for the tutorial.

This is the first time I use Sapper and Rollup so please open an issue if I'm doing something very wrong.
